# Amazon Sales Data Analysis
 # Project Explanation:

## Topic: Analyzing Amazon Sales Data

Analyzing information such as sale price, product sold by cities and states, stock levels, categories, size, and color, businesses can identify trends, understand customer preferences, and optimize their inventory and marketing strategies.

## Dataset:
The dataset chosen for this project is the Amazon Sale Report dataset from the data.world website.

## Data Cleaning and Data Modeling Steps:
1. Promoted the first row as header.
2. Split columns using Delimiter “|” and then deleted unnecessary columns.
3. Replaced NULL values with Blank.

# Business Questions:

Visualizations that I plan to create include sales per city and state, number of sellers, sale amount, sale units, and reviews received for products, along with displaying sale amount by month using line graphs and area charts.

To answer the business questions, the following queries will be explored:

1. What are the top-selling products by sales amount?
2. How do sales vary across different regions, i.e., state and cities? Which are the TOP 5 cities and states where the product is being sold?
3. Is there a correlation between the number of reviews received and sales performance?
